      As we grow up, we learn from our mothers. They are the ones who nurture us and teach us the things we need to know in order to grow up to be successful adults. 
      A mother is someone who is always there for you when you need her the most. 
      She is the one who loves you unconditionally and would do anything for you.
      A mother is someone who is strong when you need her to be and soft when you need her to be. 
      She is someone who you can always count on.
